For database systems courses in Computer Science This book introduces the fundamental concepts necessary for designing, using, and implementing database systems and database applications. Our presentation stresses the fundamentals of database modeling and design, the languages and models provided by the database management systems, and database system implementation techniques.The book is meant to be used as a textbook for a one- or two-semester course in database systems at the junior, senior, or graduate level, and as a reference book. The goal is to provide an in-depth and up-to-date presentation of the most important aspects of database systems and applications, and related technologies.

Every integrated software development environment in the world--open-source, standards-based, and proprietary--now supports UML and, more importantly, the model-driven approach to software development. This makes learning the newest UML standard, UML 2.false, critical for all software developers--and there isn''t a better choice than this clear, step-by-step guide to learning the language."
--Richard Mark Soley, Chairman and CEO, OMG

If you''re like most software developers, you''re building systems that are increasingly complex. Whether you''re creating a desktop application or an enterprise system, complexity is the big hairy monster you must manage.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps you manage this complexity. Whether you''re looking to use UML as a blueprint language, a sketch tool, or as a programming language, this book will give you the need-to-know information on how to apply UML to your project. While there are plenty of books available that describe UML, Learning UML 2.false will show you how to use it. Topics covered include:

Capturing your system''s requirements in your model to help you ensure that your designs meet your users'' needs
Modeling the parts of your system and their relationships
Modeling how the parts of your system work together to meet your system''s requirements
Modeling how your system moves into the real world, capturing how your system will be deployed

Engaging and accessible, this book shows you how to use UML to craft and communicate your project''s design. Russ Miles and Kim Hamilton have written a pragmatic introduction to UML based on hard-earned practice, not theory. Regardless of the software process or methodology you use, this book is the one source you need to get up and running with UML 2.false. Additional information including exercises can be found at www.learninguml2.com.

Russ Miles is a software engineer for General Dynamics UK, where he works with Java and Distributed Systems, although his passion at the moment is Aspect Orientation and, in particular, AspectJ. Kim Hamilton is a senior software engineer at Northrop Grumman, where she''s designed and implemented a variety of systems including web applications and distributed systems, with frequent detours into algorithms development.', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KykBVS2kL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg', true, 2704);

But if code isnÔÇÖt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.

Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code ÔÇ£on the flyÔÇØ into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmerÔÇöbut only if you work at it.

What kind of work will you be doing? YouÔÇÖll be reading codeÔÇölots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whatÔÇÖs right about that code, and whatÔÇÖs wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.

Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeÔÇöof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and ÔÇ£smellsÔÇØ gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code
